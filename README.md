## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Paisabazaar, a digital financial services marketplace, deals with millions of customer applications for loans and credit cards. A core challenge is identifying applicants with high default risk or potential fraudulent behavior. This project explores and prepares the dataset for predictive modeling that can support fraud detection and credit risk classification.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Steps Performed

- âœ… Loaded and cleaned raw dataset
- âœ… Handled missing values and inconsistent data
- âœ… Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- âœ… Visualized credit score distributions and feature relationships
- âœ… Cleaned and standardized column names
- âœ… Identified key factors contributing to fraud and poor credit

---

## ðŸ“Œ Insights & Findings

- Customers with poor credit scores often have late payments, high credit card utilization, and multiple loan inquiries.
- Several features had missing values, which were handled using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Visual patterns helped classify users into risk groups.

## âœ… Conclusion

This analysis lays the groundwork for building a machine learning model to predict credit risk or detect fraudulent applications. Financial platforms like Paisabazaar can leverage such insights to automate and improve their credit evaluation processes, leading to better risk management and reduced fraud.

## ðŸ”® Future Work

- Build ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict credit score risk or fraud likelihood.
- Deploy the model as a web app using Streamlit.
- Integrate real-time data pipelines and APIs.
